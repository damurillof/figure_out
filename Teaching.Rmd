Sometimes I like to do projects and then post them on the internet for the whole world to benefit!
here's some examples. 

## [ESMA3101: Estad√≠stica Aplicada I](https://didier-murillo.netlify.com/ESMA3101/)

- An RMarkdown presentation on the common mistakes made in visualization and how to fix them.
- Includes a GitHub repo for access to all the code.
- Look at how high quality my work is, hire and or collaborate with me.
